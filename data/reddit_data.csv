"Hi and good evening everyone, 

Well besides having problems with my Trader workstation installing ( which I posted on the IB page ) let's talk about my positions 

John Deere ( DE ) , bought it November at 391.77 and it's currently at $445.61 with an updated stop loss at 366.60. the stock seems still strong and is very near it's 52 week high of **448.31** . It's still in it's evaluation period for another 3  weeks or so, my target range during evaluation is 454.54 to 485.81 and I have set up the auto sell for 2/8/2023 +-3days depending on the evaluation summary. 

United Rentals ( URI ), just bought it at 347.05 and it's currently at $ 356.57 with a stop loss at 322.76. I really really wanted to buy this stock 2 weeks ago and missed it at 343.40 because I was late to the market, and then this time, I bit the bullet and bought at 347 and watched it the next day drop to 342-34. Could have gotten the better fill if I had waited, most likely, BUT knowing my luck, something would have happened and it would have rallied before I could get the fill LOL. ... It's in evaluation right now till 1/23/2023 +-3days depending on the evaluation summary with a target range of 402 to 430 and auto sell date of 3/6/2023 +-3 days 

RTX May19'23 135 Calls  RAYTHEON TECH Bought 4x on 11/15 for .24 each,, now they are trading at .28  , since these are under weekly evaluation ( quick tool that makes me happy, I am using  [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)   , I am currently targeting .52-.61 range in the next 3 weeks  because I don't see the stock above 110 in the month of December ( I want to be wrong trust me LOL ) 

AMZN Oct20'23 145 Call AMAZON.COM  Bought 1 (one) on 11/11 for 4.27 and now they are trading at 2.45 my target exit price is around 6.00 - 8.00 which I don't see happening till February-March when I think the stock will have rebound to 120-130 without any volatility change.  if the stock trades 88 or below upon closing for 2 days then I will auto sell and close with the loss. 

What I discovered to late and should have found earlier was  

##### MGRC - MCGRATH RENTCORP that would have been a great buy at 91.45 missed it but the research to discover it was solid. 

History tells me that we are near the bottom and I will write up a separate view for that.  

I don't use margin excessively (I don't exceed 1.22 leverage). I am researching till a trade needs to be exited or a super viable trade in which I can comfortably ( mental aspect ) commit to having leverage in excess of 1.30 

my tiny portfolio's return with the losses and gains from November left me with 8.93 return. and I am planning to add a little but more funds to be able to stay at .90 leverage and have money for the next trade. my personal comfort level is about 3-4 equities and 2 option trades open at any time. exceeding that, I get jittery and refuse to pull the triggers for the trades.

Good luck and your counter points to my positions are always welcomed.",AMZN,1670198806.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zcqjnr/o_where_do_i_stand_week_ending_122/,0.9936
"Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and I write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

Big Week, we made a lot of $$$ correctly calling that JPow will be dovish, as a matter of fact, the day of the meeting after we had a bunch of reports come out in the am (and the market reacting poorly to them) I doubled downed a said we will a surprisingly dovish JPow based on the numbers we got that morning, and we did!**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/z7ih4q7ctw3a1.jpg?width=447&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37926c13317f7ea38b2f9b4da5e18bd75909b962

We will go more in-depth into what he said later on as it changes a lot of things now.

We also nailed GDP and PCE predictions as well.

Job numbers were surprising on Friday, usually, these don't really have an effect on the market that's why I had no play for them, but since JPow said it's a key focus moving on forward, the market took a hit on bad numbers. (they are not as bad as people think, ill explain when we discuss the next job numbers plays),

For earnings, MRVL paid off as it ran hard before the earnings at which point I got out (because why risk it with earnings, IV crush, etc…) but the earnings play itself was wrong, so an L there, DG puts paid off well.

From the watchlist, NFLX was an absolute BEAST, sold at 300%+, and re-entered some more for that gap fill, been pounding the table on that one for weeks and we keep banking off it!

Our 10x play VIX puts, was successful as well, it didn't 10x but still went 22.5 to 19, 200-300% play ( I didn't take the play btw)

For those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 38 Closing Amount:** $14,097  
**Port % Change:** 1410%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 38 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

I sold most of my swings from last week as they ran 50-500%+,Sold COIN at loss (what a turd), Sold AMD at breakeven (I'm an idiot lol), TQQQ (50%-70%), NFLX (300%+), SPX (100%-500%), TSLA (50%-100%)

Like I said last week as we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash,

I have now around $12K in cash and hold

* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* SPX 12/08/2022 220.00 C

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 12/05**

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Nov)

**Thursday 12/08**

08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims

**Friday 12/09**

08:30 AM Core PPI (MoM) (Nov)

08:30 AM Core PPI (YoY) (Nov)

10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Expectations (Dec)

10:00 AM Wholesale Inventories (MoM)

So normally the only important event this week would be offcourse PPI and for the most part, it is, but after JPow made it clear how workforce participation is the final part to tame inflation, people will be keeping an eye on the initial Jobless claims.

While this is not a  job report, we can expect some sort of market reaction to it, especially given how poorly the Friday report did. Now speaking of the Friday report, The reason why it was so off is that household surveys and NFP are measured in very different ways, likely people with jobs or the gig economy are skewing the data. ADP report showed us that people are still losing jobs. I think we will be ok here, but it's a little too soon to tell.

PPI is going to be a very important report, usually, it comes after CPI, and usually, it follows it, so it might be safe to assume if PPI is good so will CPI and vice versa.PPI YoY  is expected to come in at 7.2% vs 8% Previous and MoM 0.2% vs 0.2% Previous

Core PPI YoY  is expected to come in at 5.9% vs 6.7% Previous and MoM 0.2% vs 0% Previous

So it seems that forecasts are pretty dovish here, and if we are able to meet expectations or beat we should get a nice run as people start to price in a CPI beat as well, and not only that but our second PPI report decline in a row.

I think we continue the trend here and we meet expectations, there are a lot of price reductions that weren't even priced in yet from the last report, so ill be getting an ATM SPX Call 12/14 on Thursday as a play for PPI.

# Earnings

PS we played all these earnings before in my 1st or 2nd weekly watchlist, we have come full circle, nice!

* Technology
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.154 & Revenue $106M
* Options pricing in a 16.4% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish, and tech missed for the most part, but GTLB has been beasting the past few earnings and RBC & BofA expect a beat, I'm going with calls on this one.

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.96 & Revenue $1.81B

# Watchlist

**- AMZN Long**

AMZN ran on record holiday shopping numbers but has since lagged behind, if it is able to hold 21MA on the daily, it can bounce to the 50MA, taking a swing position if 21MA holds

**- MRVL Long**

Despite earnings, MRVL has great fundamentals and a great-looking chart, looking to add a long position here, will cut below 50MA. Holding for 200MA test

**- AMD Long**

AMD has been stuck in a channel for a while now, if it is able to break through the $79 resistance, this can quickly test the 200MA, Will wait for the trigger to enter a position

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

This is the 3rd im doing NFLX as 10x play but, we made a lot of $$ on it the first 2 times, Taking the same week 325c for the gap fill, That is a $10 move to $330. The speed at which the gap fills will determine how much $$ we make, so fingers crossed for a 1-day fill.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice!",AMZN,1670172162.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zceh85/my_full_plan_for_this_week_1128_challenge_update/,0.9972
