"So a lot of people asked me to recount this, God knows why, but I'm happy to do it if I can get it done before the Astros game.

In 1987 I was at UT, having just finished my freshman year. I was interested in the markets, so I applied for an internship with Dean Witter.

They didn't take anyone who wasn't going into their junior year, but the broker who was looking (Ken) really dug my interview and recommended me to the manager for a second interview, because he wanted to go against the custom to get me.

That interview is a whole other story but when he asked ""why shouldn't I give you this position"", my answer was ""because if you do, one day I'll take your job"". He was aggressive, loved that, and let Ken hire me.

I went in after class three days a week and made cold calls and stuff. It wasn't selling, that wasn't legal because I had no license. I was gathering information and trying to get people to talk to Ken. 

I was good at it and into it. My parents bought me some ties and nice shirts and slacks and so forth, and I dug in hard. I was putting up big numbers.

Ken was a giant broker with his own little suite in the office on one end. Had his own reception area, conference room, and giant office. He was also as cool a 40 year old dude as my 18 year old ass had ever met. 

Anyway, one day I get out of class and head to the office as per usual.

I walk in and there are women running everywhere, literally like the building was on fire. I thought there was a plumbing leak, fire, or fight or something. Back then we didn't think about active shooters.

As I walk past the empty reception desk I see the first glass-walled office and this older dude, probably my current age (55) literally sitting at his desk crying like a fat kid who dropped his ice cream. I mean sobbing audibly through the window.

I turn right to head to Ken's office suite and I see the same. Guys screaming into their headsets (we had wires attached to our phones back then), some crying, and the assistants running around. 

I found out the pneumatic tubes we used to send orders (they were handwritten on tickets back then) were overloaded and broken. They were running orders to the cage for processing.

I get to Ken's office and walk in and he's on he phone and he literally waves his hand at me and screams ""GET THE FUCK OUT!!!!!""

I'm in complete shock.

I go to leave and his assistant runs past me back to his office and I keep going to the door.

She runs back and grabs me and says ""wait... he needs you to call all these people and tell them to relax and answer the phone because Ken's gonna call them soon.""

She hands me his ""B book"", which is the way he kept his clients. They were on paper with ticket copies behind each person's page. They were arranged usually by size of account and activity. He was calling the ""A book"" and I was letting the B people know he was going to get with them.

So the actual Dean Witter computer system got overwhelmed and pseudo-crashed.

When we were placing orders they were coming back all fucked up in batches. So 10 people would sell IBM, and the trades were so fast and furious and everyone was selling that you couldn't match a sale to a ticket.

At the end of the day the floor sent us massive notices that said shit like ""your branch sold 10,000 shares of IBM at $100 (no idea if that was the price - just an example), 8,000 at $90, 15,000 at 87 5/8 (that's the way the prices used to be, in 1/8s), and 23,000 at 84."" 

We all met in the conference room (I was there to find Ken's client pages when he asked for them) and literally, I shit you not, argued over who would get what price for which client.

The manager would say ""we've got 27,000 shares of Dell at 4 and 5/8 gone, 18,000 at 3 7/8, and 50 thousand at 2 7/8. Make your pitch.""

Ken would say ""I need 10,000 of those at 4 5/8. My guy has 2.4 million with us, he's been my client for 5 years, and he fucking deserves it.""

Then other guys would ask for shares and the manager would ask who they were for and why they should get them.

We were there all night. These guys cussed each other, cussed the manager, threw shit, stormed out and came back... it was a fucking war.

Basically the bigtime brokers got the best prices, and they gave their best prices to their best customers.

The thing is, that practice is illegal. It's called allocating trades. It what made Hillary Clinton a PILE of money in futures. She always got the lowest buy price and the highest sale. Not in that crash, way later. Long story but check it out.

Anyway, that was all kinds of fuckery. Guys quit over it. If the manager didn't like you, your customers got raped.

So we were there fighting for pricing til like 9 or 10, and calling clients to deliver the bad news until almost 1 a.m.

So that sucked, but the weirdest was yet to come.

Ken asked me to skip class the next day to help him call everyone he couldn't get ahold of, help the assistant field incoming calls, and work the paperwork for his books. I did it. Screw it. This was gonna be my career.
 
I get there at like 7:30 and there are two effing armed guards at the double doors, which were closed and locked. 

I ask if we're closed (I just assumed the whole firm had gone under  -  I was still in a half daze), and got ready to leave. Security guy asks my name. I say ""Bob Wheeler. I work for Ken.""

Dude knocks on the door and says ""Bob Wheeler. Kid who works for Ken.""

The door opens and another armed guy lets me in. He takes my backpack and empties it on the reception desk. Says ""okay, take your stuff.""

I get back to Ken's suite and find out from his assistant that we're all getting free breakfast. It was massive and badass. Like everything you could ever want. Bacon, eggs, biscuits, juices, fruits. I mean a major spread. 

So I ask her if it was bonus for some kind of great job and she shocks me to death.

She says ""no, and we're getting lunch too. We're locked in. We aren't leaving til the market closes and no clients are allowed in. There've been several death threats to basically everyone. When you leave you'll have an armed guard.""

I about shit my pants. It wasn't the same for a LONG TIME. The guys didn't go out for drinks together anymore, people didn't walk into each other's offices, nothing. For six weeks it was like working in a fucking cemetery.

To Ken's credit he had people buying with both hands and I'm sure everyone who listened ended up rich, but it was a goddamned bloodbath and lots of brokers never recovered.

So that's the story. When the market goes down 5% I'm not fazed.",IBM,1666223346.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ia9y/my_1987_crash_experience/,-0.9833
"I'm most surprised by the IBM pick. Barron's called it ""baby Microsoft"" and:

>Under CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM has spun off a pedestrian business of managing data centers into Kyndryl Holdings (KD), refocused on the cloud and artificial intelligence, and vowed to start growing again for the first time in about a decade.

> Wall Street is skeptical about IBM’s prospects, but one bull, BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, has compared Krishna to Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO who transformed the company over the past seven years.
> 
> IBM, whose shares trade around $126, is valued at 11 times projected 2022 earnings. And it has the highest dividend yield in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 5.3%.
> 
> If Krishna is successful in boosting sales and margins while making IBM relevant again, there could be a lot of upside in a largely forgotten stock.

"Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""Why did the markets go up/down today?""

And there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, ""Because there were more buyers than sellers"" (or vice versa).

Apple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.

However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.

Some folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.

With all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and ""fly"" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.

Full disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.

There is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

I think the moves in these ""value"" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. ""You won't be fired for buying IBM"". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP?

IBM (IBM) on Thursday debuted the world’s first 2-nanometer chip making technology, which could enable massive performance gains in terms of both power and battery life over the current industry-leading processors found in everything from smartphones and tablets to the massive computer servers that power the cloud.

“Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know on the verge of getting to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

“What we're talking about here is the first time in the world that anybody has shown, externally, that there's a viable technology to enable the 2-nm node.”

Slashing the carbon footprint of data centers, which account for one percent of global energy useiii. Changing all of their servers to 2 nm-based processors could potentially reduce that number significantly.

Hey, so I've been riding the wave after GME trying to find a few places to store cash that could help diversify my portfolio and help to keep my gains from riding that rocket. One of those is IBM. Theres an insane amount of reasons I've decided to go with this company, and at first it was as a nest egg option to help grow my account at a consistent rate (dividends are @ 4.56% right now). It also has HUGE upside potential, it is in basically the same industry as Microsoft but only has a market cap of 117 billion vs Microsofts HUGE 2.3T. Doing the math there is goddamn simple and if you were in the market for mad gains why would you not look at this as a huge growth investment.

Now there has been a huge crash on IBM, take it from me this is a sale. Big Blue missed their quarterly revenue by .06 billion, but they met their expected eps. Some short seller went on tv a couple days ago before their report and basically bashed them saying they were a prime short selling target [Jim Chanos, betting against IBM, accuses firm of 'financial engineering' (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/short-seller-jim-chanos-reveals-bet-against-ibm-ahead-of-earnings-this-week.html) .

The reason this crash is so enticing is because of a spinoff company named Kyndryl. IBM will be splitting off its managed infrastructure services portion and making it into a tradable company. sometime in November. WHICH BY THE WAY IS ALSO FREE MONEY (sort of, not sure yet how it will correct IBM), for every 5 shares of IBM you get 1 share of Kyndryl. Besides the free Kyndryl stock, IBM is now free to pave the way with a lighter and more streamlined company, and their focus is basically the same mark et as microsoft. I do want to heed caution, please look at their stats before just diving right into the stock. It isn't some high profit margin machine, the idea is that it will develop into one though with the shedding of some weight via Kyndryl.",IBM,1634912982.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qdi4rx/great_pricing_to_jump_in_on_ibm/,0.9713

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

## Hypothesis

* INTC is not a dying company
* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement
* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle
* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years
* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail
* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share
* INTC’s new products are the top-notch of the sector

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

## Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used.

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|18.26|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|18.26%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|

## Dividend Discount Model

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.

Knowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.

The model gives the following result:

|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|
|:-|:-|
|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|

&#x200B;

## Total Payout Model

It is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|
|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|
|Total Payout Model|\-$12.22|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&E

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

"Hey Reddit investing geniuses, since previous Reddit favorites NVDA and AMD have lost almost half their values, I’ve been wondering what could go wrong with current favorites such as GOOG. This tweet caught my eye, via @ OutsizedGains:

[$GOOG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GOOG&src=cashtag_click) smells of Ballmer-era [$MSFT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MSFT&src=cashtag_click). Founders departed long ago to sip mojitos, suits swooped in to siphon the cash cow. Too many pampered employees earning 6-7 digits to squeeze out a few %. Ad blocker risk.  Where’s the next GMail, YouTube, Android? Those happened 15 yrs ago.

There comes a time in the life of every tech company when no-one gives a shit about the tech. The culture transitions to financial engineering, Fat Fire, paying off McMansion mortgages.  HP, IBM, MS.  Be careful the day the founders leave the building.

"I'm just curious how sentiment today compares to the dot-com bubble. Back then many speculative companies were down over 80% and even a lot of solid companies were down 40%+.

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.25%**|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-3.60%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|\-20.92%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

note: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|12.68%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|

This gives us a fair value of **$46.50**

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|

Note:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros

The company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&E

# Revenue Forecast

With the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%

## Analysts Price Target

**$72 High**

**$32.74 Average**

**$18 Low**

**$32.71 OP’s**

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

The cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|12.68%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|

This gives us a fair value of **$46.50**

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|

Note:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros

The company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&E

# Revenue Forecast

With the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%

## Analysts Price Target

**$72 High**

**$32.74 Average**

**$18 Low**

**$32.71 OP’s**

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

The cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

## Hypothesis

* INTC is not a dying company
* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement
* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle
* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years
* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail
* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share
* INTC’s new products are the top-notch of the sector

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

## Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.71**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.54**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.45%**|
|Hurdle Rate|11.64%|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-0.16%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|12.80%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,106,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|18.26|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|18.26%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|

## Dividend Discount Model

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.

Knowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.

The model gives the following result:

|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|
|:-|:-|
|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|

&#x200B;

## Total Payout Model

It is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|
|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|
|Total Payout Model|\-$12.22|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&E

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

"As a investor, who is 70pct technical and 30pct fundamental, I am convinced that IBM ( the big supertanker) is finally unstuck from the Suez canal on its way to open seas ! On Thu/Fri it broke 1 key hurdles: broke over a 18 month channel ceiling and also broke over the short term upward trend line.

Sadly I cannot post my chart on this subreddit beacuse ( in a strange way they do not allow images) but may post it on the dividends subreddit since this is a nice dividend stock.

"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

"So, IBM is making a move spinning of into two companies. 

Is it worth going in right now? Or wait until the spinoff happens. 

I believe The company that keeps the cloud and red-hat will be a growth entity, esp in hybrid IT space.",IBM,1630379084.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pexh2d/ibm_buy_now_or_wait_for_company_spinoff/,0.5423
" **What is Happening?**

IBM is spinning off its legacy business of IT Management in order to attempt to return $IBM to its blue-chip glory. IBM will now look to take advantage of the[ $1T hybrid-cloud market](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&id=26c150e11d&e=0a139504b4) and its $34B acquisition of Red Hat in 2018. 

**Why does this Matter?**

This is a major shift for a company that has long been considered an American household name. The spinoff is expected to contain more than 50% of the current business, however, IBM is now positioned to be considered more of a software company than a services vendor moving forward. The operational costs of the spinoff are estimated to be in the $5B range.  
 

*“We divested networking back in the ‘90s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn’t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition”*  
*IBM CEO Arvind Krishna*

The two separate firms will be paying a joint dividend in line with the expected dividend for the fourth quarter. From there, it is expected that IBM continues to look for future acquisition opportunities as they make an aggressive push for revenue growth. 

**The Takeaway from Taylor Hoffman Capital Management:**

"I've been sitting around jerking it to my crypto gains while the the equities market is busy trying to decide if we're each getting checks for 100 GME shares or if we're about to have the world's largest civil war re-enactment.

In my zen-like state of post-nut clarity, I figured I'd share a little DD I've been cooking up. About 6 years ago, I saw a little noticed the after the-bell earnings report for AMD. Back then AMD wasn't the OG millionaire printer they are today. They were a has-been boomer stock, that went up against Intel, lost big time, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. For almost a decade AMD was mismanaged, producing 2nd rate video cards and 3rd rate processors. They spent all their money and talent designing low margin chips for OEMs and one off projects (gaming consoles mostly) and spun off their manufacturing arm in a frenzied bid to stay afloat. But after this earnings report AMD jumped like 30%, from jack-shit to 30% higher than jack-shit. The reason for that is of course, Su Bae and her brilliant operational excellence. Anyone who took note of AMD back then is now rich as shit as the stock has climbed 30x since that little earnings report.
I could give you a history lesson about AMD, but this DD isn't about AMD. That ship has sailed and at best you're looking at a 2-3 bagger, complete with a massive implied vol on the options which would completely drown your gains.

No, this story goes back farther than AMD. Before Lisa Su was queen of the CPU racket, she spent a decade at a little company called IBM. The ones who made the Thinkpads your dad was using while getting a BJ from his secretary under his desk, real 90s shit. This was a boomer stock before there were boomer stocks.
So why the fuck am I doing a DD about IBM? Because this is the year it all turns around for IBM.

I could go on about IBM trades at a 14.5 times P/E and has a 5% dividend yield, but that's the opposite of what you want to hear. Don't worry, they keep making less money each year, so that sweet boomer dividend will be gone before you know it.

IBM is spinning off their legacy business that makes all the money, but is making less of it each year, and their Redhat/AI/Cloud business into two separate companies. Now if the market weren't full of Chads who only want to see y/y earnings growth %, having a free second cash cow business that paid the dividend while your AI and Cloud business grew would be seen as a good thing. So if you have IBM when they complete the split, and you can ditch the dividend shares if you want.

Now some 🌈🐻 think IBM can't turn around because their legacy business is declining. But IBM is now on the path towards competing with Microsoft and Amazon. They bought Redhat, which every tech company uses. They have analytics, they have quantum computing, they have ai/machine learning, they have blockchain, and they're making ""hybrid-cloud"", which is just part cloud, part onsite, which governments and companies with sensitive information will love. Something Microsoft and Amazon don't do. Now don't get me wrong, IBM has been saying they were going to do all this for years, but last spring they finally put in a CEO who can steer the ship in the wrong direction.

Arvind Krishna, remember the name. The man has a PhD in electrical engineering and has been living and breathing cloud more than your baja hoodie wearing college roommate after a bong rip.

AMD grew quickly when they got the right CEO because they had all the infrastructure in place to be a big company. IBM is where AMD was 6 years ago except they're ready to transform back into a VERY big company.

All IBM needs to do is cut the stupid dividend, and start using that sweet cash flow to buy up other tech companies. They need search, so companies like ESTC are big potential acquisition targets, and they need edge networking, so they could easily acquire a company like NET or FSLY. Once the market realizes what IBM is in the process of becoming, they're going 🚀🚀🚀.

Judy Lin, DIGITIMES Asia, Taipei

Tuesday 15 November 2022

&#x200B;

For the first time in his 91 years of life, US billionaire Warren Buffett has recently invested in a semiconductor stock. It is not any of the American semiconductor companies, but TSMC, a company on which many may want to reduce their reliance because Taiwan is the ""most dangerous place on earth."" What did Buffett see in TSMC to make this investment decision?

&#x200B;

According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filing for its equity investments in the third quarter, it spent more than US$4.1 billion buying 60.1 million shares of TSMC's American deposit receipt (ADR).

&#x200B;

""When Buffett makes a move, he might have monitored the financial performance and the fundamentals of his target for more than 10 years. That is exactly the case with his investment in Apple,"" said Nobunaga Chai, special research consultant at the Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association (PIDA). Chai has worked as a senior semiconductor analyst in equity investment companies and independent research institutes.

&#x200B;

Chai went on to say, ""As a value investing guru, Warren Buffett only picks the companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios, and TSMC passed all of the tests when its stock prices fell through the floors in Q3.""

&#x200B;

Berkshire Hathaway sold BYD before purchasing TSMC, while Apple remains the largest tech investment that Buffett made in Berkshire's US$362 billion equity portfolio, according to Reuters.

&#x200B;

As Buffett has been famous for his patience to make long-term and ""snowballing"" investments, does he not worry about the geopolitical risks where some say China is going to invade Taiwan and take over TSMC in this decade?

&#x200B;

""Obviously, Buffett won't do the investment if he sees that scenario to take place in at least 20 years,"" said Chai.

&#x200B;

Although many analysts interpreted Berkshire's decision to sell BYD and buy TSMC as a signal that Buffett sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), Chai said it may not be necessarily so. ""Valuation is the first rule of the game for value investing people. Buffett would not buy TSMC when its stock prices were too expensive, and he sold BYD perhaps because the EV and battery maker's stock prices have exceeded reasonable valuation.""

&#x200B;

The fact that TSMC has been issuing stable cash dividends over the past 20 years and has maintained robust growth momentum despite the current cyclical downturn in the tech industries, may also have been the reasons that triggered Buffett's decision to buy the stock.

&#x200B;

Of course, Buffett is not always right about his investment decisions. His investment in IBM did not pan out, but his faith in Apple has been proven right, which is relatively strong in performance so far during the severe downcycle currently experienced by other smartphone and notebook companies.

&#x200B;

TSMC reported stellar performance for its third-quarter 2022 earnings, with a gross margin of 60.4%, operating margin of 50.6%, and net profit margin of 45.8% - results very few hardware manufacturers can achieve. ""Very rarely does a company have all of the three pillars of competitive edge, namely - process technology, client structure, and ecosystem. But TSMC got them all,"" said DIGITIMES chairman and president Colley Hwang, at the US-Taiwan High-tech Forum (UTHF) co-organized by the North American Taiwanese Engineering and Science Association (NATEA) and DIGITIMES at Silicon Valley recently.

&#x200B;

""Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies,"" said Wendell Huang, VP and chief financial officer of TSMC during the third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. ""Moving into the fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies.""

&#x200B;

TSMC has warned that the biggest inventory adjustment of the industry will take place in the first half of 2023. Chances are Buffett must have taken that into consideration.",IBM,1668525901.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yw08ip/what_did_buffett_see_in_tsmc_with_us41_bln_stock/,0.9902

"What in the world is going on with AMD. AMD is currently sitting at 498 out of 503 SPY500 companies YTD.

Looking at the different time frames (2 year, 1 month, 5 day), AMD has underperformed the semi sector on every timeframe.

[Semi performance \(2 year\)](https://preview.redd.it/ar5toexf7yu91.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=32792845d9a911b4e20756699550b423a5d37f20)

This underperformance comes at a time when AMD has consolidated in a box for 8 days with MACD crossing over and RSI extremely oversold. Furthermore, AMD has had 6 straight red weekly closes, the most in its entire history. RSI heavily oversold on the weekly too.

[AMD daily, MAC D crossover, RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/6uz6nxuo7yu91.png?width=2291&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34bc9df6ce5db2ee29bf815106482256fa13aac7)

Then we get to this week's earnings. Every semi related company to report beat expectations:

$TSM, $ASML, $LRCX, $IBM.

AMD's PE ratio is at 24.05 with a forward PE of 11.81. AMD is currently trading well below pre-Covid levels. Revenue and free cash flow are both trending up and AMD is expected to post revenues comparable to Nvdia this quarter and grow 30% (in this environment).

""AMD's data center revenue increased 45% year over year to $1.6 billion last quarter. Additionally, the company's gaming revenue was up 14% to $1.6 billion despite the weakness in the graphics card market. ""

This seems heavily overdone...

The S&P 500 (\^GSPC) marched up 2.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) rallied more than 700 points, or 2.5%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) gained 2.3%. Treasuries retreated after a relentless climb in recent days that saw the benchmark 10-year note temporarily rise above 4.3%, a level not seen since 2008.

Even with the past two down days, equities closed the week out sharply higher thanks to mega rallies on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

As some of you may or may not know IBM is splitting into 2 companies next year. IBM has also experienced significant layoffs in the US and will do so in Europe. This is unfortunately not great news for the employees who were hit by the layoffs, but it is a good sign for investors.

IBM has become WAY too big (300,000 employees), and WAY to diverse. It will be splitting into a Consulting business and IBM will stay as a tech company. This means that next year IBM will be a lighter ship which will be easier to maneuver, innovate, and deliver. Im in it for a long haul. What are your thoughts?

" 

My word-find function has been going into overdrive this earnings season, looking for a few key phrases in earnings-call transcripts: “Foreign exchange.” “Currencies.” “Dollar.”

Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann summed it up succinctly in his company’s conference call: “The FX drag is significant.”

The rise of the U.S. dollar, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases, among other factors, is triggering quite the knock-on effect to corporate profits. While investors might want to strip out currency impacts to get a better idea of fundamental demand, they should also prepare for these hits to last a while.

In a report this week titled, “King Dollar Has More Room to Gain,” Wells Fargo strategist Erik Nelson cited multiple drivers for continued dollar strength, including the currency’s traditional resilience at times of market stress.

 

 

“The dollar index can continue to rally here,” [Chris Vecchio, senior strategist at DailyFX](https://news.yahoo.com/u-dollar-become-bit-wrecking-135949290.html), told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this week. “To use an old axiom, the dollar remains the nicest house in a bad neighborhood.”

That is, while the U.S. economy may be slowing and even entering a recession, many other global economies are faring worse. In currencies, it’s all relative.

That dollar strength is costing companies. Citi strategists estimate that a 10% bump in the dollar index will cut $15 to $20 from S&P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&.tsrc=fin-srch) has rallied more than 17% this year versus a basket of currencies. The greenback is up 14% versus the [euro](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EURUSD=X?p=EURUSD=X&.tsrc=fin-srch), and a whopping 30% against the Japanese [yen](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPY=X?p=JPY=X&.tsrc=fin-srch).

This early earnings season is littered with examples of the ensuing costs. IBM [numbers beat estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ibm-tops-earnings-estimates-even-133748190.html), even as the company said currency translation cost it $1.1 billion last quarter. Netflix’s [operating margin dropped to 19.3% from 23.5% last quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-posts-strong-q3-earnings-132543331.html) — a decline it blamed almost entirely on the dollar’s gain. And Procter and Gamble [will take a $3.9 billion, after-tax hit from currency effects this year](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PG?p=PG&.tsrc=fin-srch).

Large companies do have the ability to hedge, or offset, the gains in the dollar in various ways, including covering expenses in local currencies. But the dollar’s move has been so big and so rapid this year that even the most seasoned hedgers have had difficulty adjusting.

It’s also tough for corporations to predict the dollar’s move six months to a year to even 18 months ahead, as they would need for hedging, Jefferies Managing Director and Head of Corporate Hedging and FX Solutions Joseph Lewis told Yahoo Finance Live recently: “The hardest part for companies right now to determine is, will this persist? You can take 10 economists — they’ll say slightly different things, have slightly different forecasts. I think that’s been really challenging for my clients; there isn’t a consistency in view.”

So, what are investors to do when it comes to factoring in the effect of the dollar? The bottom line for Citi’s Scott Chronert: “USD relevant for equities but not the main driver,” he wrote in a recent note. Rather, he said, investors should focus on “underlying business trends and conditions.”

Investors have another option, as Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre [pointed out in Wednesday’s Morning Brief](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wall-street-is-warming-up-to-small-cap-stocks-100019747.html): They can invest in small-cap companies, which generally have less exposure to currency fluctuations than large cap companies.",IBM,1666353959.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y9s0l6/king_dollar_is_making_a_royal_feast_of_corporate/,0.5267

"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on.

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting.

Just in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.

I think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?

For Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.

For Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China.
