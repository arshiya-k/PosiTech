"Meta [US:META] Platforms Inc. is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could be among the largest round in a recent spate of tech job cuts after the industry’s rapid growth during the pandemic.

The layoffs are expected to affect many thousands of employees and an announcement is planned to come as soon as Wednesday, according to the people. Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the people said.

The planned layoffs would be the first broad headcount reductions to occur in the company’s 18-year history. While smaller on a percentage basis than the cuts at Twitter Inc. this past week, which hit about half of that company’s staff, the number of Meta employees expected to lose their jobs could be the largest to date at a major technology corporation in a year that has seen a tech industry retrenchment. 

A spokesman for Meta declined to comment, referring The Wall Street Journal to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statement that the company would “focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas.”

“So that means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,” he said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 26. “In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.”

The Journal reported in September that Meta was planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions.

**Zuck the cuck has majority of the companies vote so there's no way he'll leave the new project.**

And quite honestly I like the project, VR is awesome more immersive and funnier. There's games that are much better with VR than they were released, VR has a lot of momentum with younger generations you bunch of new boomers.

Yes it's expensive and can cause headaches but so did phones and computers in it's earlier stages some even till recently. And there's room for improvement in this technology

I try to have the same mindset that I had during this last bull run what will be the future now where can I risk my money on a future gamble, and this seems like it can be the future, Meta has tons of more cash to throw at this and the engineers.

"Facebook parent [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share (EPS): $1.64 vs $1.89 expected, according to Refinitiv

Revenue: 27.71 billion vs. $27.38 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

**Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the report:**

Monthly Active Users (MAUs): 2.96 billion vs 2.94 billion expected, according to StreetAccount

Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $9.32 expected, according to StreetAccount

Facebook’s parent is contending with a broad slowdown in online ad spending, challenges from [Apple’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) iOS privacy update and increased competition from TikTok. Add it up, and Meta is expected to post its second straight quarter of [declining sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html).

Although Meta is investing heavily in its Reels short-video service to steer users away from TikTok, the product is in the early days of generating revenue and isn’t as lucrative as Facebook’s core features, like Stories and the newsfeed.

Meta is trying to make Reels more attractive to advertisers and has announced new ad formats intended to give businesses enhanced options for promoting their products through short videos. The company also recently [debuted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/facebook-is-selling-ads-in-new-places-on-instagram-and-whatsapp-.html) new ways for companies to advertise on Instagram and Messenger, padding its overall ad inventory, which could potentially bolster overall sales.

Still, the stock is down 62% for the year, more than double the drop in the Nasdaq, and analysts are skeptical of the company’s prospects through this year and into 2023.

Bank of America recently downgraded Meta from buy to neutral and said in a research [note](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/bank-of-america-downgrades-meta-says-lower-ad-spending-could-hurt-reels.html) that “we expect advertiser budget cuts in early 2023 to weigh on sentiment and drive added uncertainty” following the Apple update and the “Reels transition.” The firm said it expects 4% growth in 2023, below Wall Street estimates of 9%, and sees “some downside risk to our estimates in a recession.”

Investors will also be focused on Meta’s user numbers, which have stagnated. Most concerning are the user figures in the U.S. and Canada, its biggest region for revenue.  

In the second quarter of 2022, Meta counted 197 million daily active users in those two North American countries, down from 198 million in the same quarter in 2020.

Meanwhile, Meta is investing billions of dollars a year into the metaverse, the yet-to-be developed digital universe that people can access with virtual reality and augmented reality headsets.

Earlier this week, Meta shareholder Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital wrote an open [letter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/altimeter-capitals-brad-gerstner-calls-on-meta-to-slash-headcount.html) to Meta, lambasting the company for employing too many workers and spending too much money on the metaverse.

The firm recommends that Meta reduce its head count by 20% and trim its metaverse investment to a maximum of $5 billion a year. Meta’s Reality Labs unit [lost](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/meta-reality-labs-reports-10-billion-loss.html) more than $10 billion in 2021.

“Meta needs to re-build confidence with investors, employees and the tech community in order to attract, inspire, and retain the best people in the world,” Gerstner wrote in the letter. “In short, Meta needs to get fit and focused.”

"I used to think that Zuckerberg only has a certain window of time to show that his metaverse push is fruitful, and if he fails to do this within that time frame, then Meta's board will vote his ass out and pull the plug on all the metaverse funding.

However, the way I understand it, is that Mark basically has full controlling power over the company, and he could literally ride this metaverse thing into the ground if he wants to, and nobody inside Meta, nor any of their other majority shareholders can do a damn thing about it. Is this correct?


NOTE: I actually believe that VR/AR will be an unbelievably dominant force in the future of humanity. It really is the next computing platform. It's a runaway train, and that train has left the station. There's no getting that toothpaste back in the bottle. The VR/AR thing will happen, **but the problem is, it could easily be another 15 to 20 years away from legit viability.**

My biggest concern is that META gets another 7 years into this Metaverse push before pulling the funding plug. I'm most concerned with them giving up on this idea six or seven years too early, or not having enough cash to power the company through all the years it's going to take to see this thing hit the finish line.

"I think it's fair to say that social media is at the moment one of the few topics where most of the population can agree to hate on. In this post I would like to deconstruct a few popular myths about Facebook/META and give my personal opinion on how I think the public image of this company has gone from bad to worse in recent history.

&#x200B;

Myth 1 - META is selling your data to advertisers.

I think this is a common misconception that a lot of people make simply because it's easy/convenient to understand META's business model like this. But reality is that META has NEVER sold any of its users data to advertisers in any of the platforms under its umbrella. Instead, when advertisers want their ads to be displayed on Facebook/Instagram, they request a target audience(things like age, occupation, interests, political orientation etc.) and pay META money. After the contract is signed, META will then use its internal algorithms and data to efficiently and accurately target ads requested by the advertiser. No personal data is transferred between META and the advertiser.

&#x200B;

One thing to add to this section is about the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2014. Facebook was not without blame of course, but they are not the main culprit. A third party app called ' This Is Your Digital Life ' improperly harvested data on 87 million Facebook users and then used that data for gaining political advantage in different election races. Facebook is guilty of improperly protecting their users data. Cambridge Analytica was basically doing the stealing while Facebook had a security issue.

&#x200B;

Myth 2 - No one is using Facebook anymore. Or at least people are leaving META's platforms in droves.

This is simply factually wrong. Global MAUs(Monthly Active Users) and DAUs(Daily Active Users) have been increasing every quarter since IPO. It is true that a slight decline started happening in Europe, while USA and Canada growth has basically stagnated(because already almost anyone is on one of the platforms). But META's reach is much beyond that. I cannot add images in this subreddit, but you can verify this yourself by searching for the MAU/DAU graphs in the last Q3 release.

&#x200B;

Myth 3 - META is investing all they have into the Metaverse.

This is again factually incorrect. Here is a direct quote from the CEO in the last conference call:

""We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.1 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses grew 18% driven mostly by employee-related costs, infrastructure-related costs, and the impairment of certain operating leases for office facilities that we plan to exit. Our current surge in capex is largely due to building out our AI infrastructure and we would expect capex to come down as a percent of revenue over the long term. ""

We can clearly see that only 18% of expenses are directed to VR/AR aka the Realty Labs segment(also the nature of these expenses is that they should come down over time and margins will improve again). The rest of the expenses are going into the traditional apps like Facebook/Instagram/Messenger/Whatsapp.

People think that Zuckerberg and his team are lunatics that will throw the whole company in jeopardy because of some dream Zuckerberg had about VR/AR. Don't forget these guys have built a gigantic company with more than 3.6 BILLION users worldwide. They have also bought Instagram and Whatsapp(people were criticizing FB back when these acquisitions were made  ) and built them out into behemoths as well.

&#x200B;

Myth 4 - META is dying, financially speaking.

While it is true that recent earning releases were lackluster, people seem to not think about the cyclicality of the advertising business. Given the current economic struggles and the projected global recession incoming, do you know how majority of business cut their expenses?  At the top of the list is cutting advertising budgets. Add to this the recent iOS privacy changes and of course META has been struggling to show growth(especially after the increased growth after the pandemic).

Zuckerberg has already mentioned that the next leg in revenue growth will not be the Metaverse, but monetizing Messenger and Whatsapp:

' Beyond Reels, messaging is another major monetization opportunity. Billions of people and millions of businesses use WhatsApp and Messenger every day, and we're confident we can connect them in ways that create valuable experiences. We started with Click-to-Messaging ads, which let businesses run ads on Facebook and Instagram that start a thread on Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram Direct so they can communicate with customers directly. This is one of our fastest growing ads products, with a $9 billion annual run rate. This revenue is mostly on Click-to-Messenger today since we started there first, but Click-to-WhatsApp just passed a $1.5 billion run rate, growing more than 80% year-over-year. '

Also, the metaverse doesn't have to take over the world in order for it to become a profitable investment.  Reality Labs has been mostly growing since 2020(at a loss) and only this year has META released the new VR headset . The growth is there, it can become profitable in the future and it doesn't mean that all of us will walk around with VR headsets and buy property in the Metaverse.

&#x200B;

Concluding thoughts - How did META's reputation got so bad?

Let me begin this by saying that I am in no way absolving META of any blame, they made/make mistakes. Their algorithms work in such a way that it brings to the surface some of the most over the top and toxic people/takes. It creates echo chambers that keeps its users engaged/addicted to its apps. At the same time I understand that the benefits that META brings to this planet, cannot come without the downsides, especially if you want to be using its services for free. You,the user, have to accept the terms and conditions that you will be the product.

I am not one to believe in conspiracy theories, I like to critically think why/how events unfold. Do you know who is also a player in the ad industry? Traditional media. It is in their direct interest if METAs public image is bad and advertisers pull their money out of META and give it to them. Same can also be said about Apple(they don't give a rat's ass about your privacy, they just want to get a bigger share of the advertising pie themselves ).

While so many other outlets will be benefiting from META's demise, it's easy to understand why a constant flow of bad news/coverage is coming towards META to destroy its reputation(worse than any other FAAMG company).

Because so many of us are using META and we all can see the glaring issues with its platforms, it's easy to hop onto a blind hate bandwagon that impairs our financial decision of whether to buy/not buy META stock without looking at the huge investing opportunity META is at its current prices.

EDIT:

Some people in the comments completely disregard the possibility of this being a great investment decision for the long term.

## The Metaverse is Coming, Later

Meta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.

Staking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn’t a bad tactic to “get it done”, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)’s approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.

### Reinvesting Into the Business

Meta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\*cough\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.

### More or Better Content

As a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.

Regarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:

* Hybrid-AI programs - content created by [AI](https://beta.openai.com/), but enriched by a content creator.
* AI program - short AI created content snips.
* Engaging in contractor services - reinvesting in strategic content creation, such as high search volume content, content for groups and assistance, etc.

## Valuation

I expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.

As a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.

You can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company’s future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.

### Risks

Meta’s key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its “shorts” feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces “cheaper” content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*

Meta’s decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.

The metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say “no” to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.

## Conclusion

The market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.

Meta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.

META looks appealing with a multiple of 14. However, I am a bit concerned about the PEG ratio, indicating that it still might be overvalued. Looking at their last few quarters, revenues are declining. That said, I still think they are a tech powerhouse, so looking to hear what the hive mind has to say.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.
