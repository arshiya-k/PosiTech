Conclusion\n","We managed to create a dataframe to use to analyze the state of the current stock market. There are some limitations/further improvements to be made in this data extraction:\n","\n","\n","*   Initially, the idea was to extract reddit posts by time. I used the `subreddit.top(time_filter = week)` expression in the program, however the resulting issue was that there were not enough posts for the dataframe. Because, as seen above, majority of the posts do not even have text. \n","*   I used the `subreddit.new(limit = 1000)` to get the last most recent 1000 posts from the given subreddits. The initial plan was to get posts filtered by keyword (*from the keyword list) given above but again, when I filtered the data, the dataframe became too small. So I have left the entire dataframe as is.\n","*   When I tried to extract more posts than a thousand, I kept getting a server side error. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPEJWeYtNv2wlJcUSmfrJtb","collapsed_sections":[],"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
